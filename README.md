  Bearded Browncoats

Description

  This was a project made for a CIS3801C Fundamentals of Mobile Web Application Development. It was designed as a website that contained information on the brick and mortar store known as Bearded Browncoats. The website is still in its formative stages, but contains the framework for what it will become. It has a home page, and events page, an about us page, a location page, and a products page. 

Installation instructions 
  
  First, you will need to log on to the Bearded Browncoat repository, found here: https://github.com/CLJones051989/BeardedBrowncoats
  Second, you will need to select the files for which module you would like. Each module will have a different component altered to the website to show competency in a category. 
  Third, you will then click on the "Raw" button to show the desired code.
  Fourth, right click within the code and click "Save As..." and it will save to your computer. 
  
Usage 

  This site was created with an experimental purpose in mind. It can be tweaked and improved, but it is mostly for personal use.
